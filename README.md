Resources for hiring a more diverse engineering team
====================================================

Diverse teams are more productive, more attractive to top talent, and better for the long-term sustainaibility of your
engineering team. Unfortunately, many people in positions of authority are at a loss for how to improve the diversity of
their teams. "Okay", they say, "I'm in. But where do I start?". This is one place to start.
